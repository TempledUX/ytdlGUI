ytdlGUI.py is a graphical user interface based in python tkinter and aimed for audio extraction from Youtube videos using youtube-dl python library.

### Instructions for manual building
For the purpose of converting the downloaded audio files by youtube-dl to mp3 files is neccessary the use of ffmpeg codecs. Just put them in the same folder as the main python script.
The ffmpeg builds for Windows can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qB1pie9edOKG9McbvkxECMVOagzi2kgh/view?usp=sharing

If you don't want to use or download the ffmpeg codecs you can download the precompiled binaries from the releases.
